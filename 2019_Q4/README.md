### progress weekly update on 11/22/2019
------------------
* Currently focusing on automl: pytesting improvement and conduct end to end test.

* Client project update:
 
  * For Canada project: the visa application is ongoing and need at least two weeks to get the visa in hand.

  * For other potential projects from @jeana.tao, I received an email yesterday from Jeana asking for my profile and scheduled a phone call with her on Dec 4, I think she has some ideas about what temperate project I could fit in.
